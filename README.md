If this is the place you want to find answers for Advent of Code 2021 then you may have come to the wrong place! 

I am teaching myself Python as I go, I will fail more than I succeed but hope each day to fail slightly better. 

I will hash out where I have made mistakes but leave them in here.  

Unlikely to be any comments!
